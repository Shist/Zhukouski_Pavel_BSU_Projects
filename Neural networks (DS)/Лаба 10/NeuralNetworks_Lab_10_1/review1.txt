Aside from the super obvious plot holes and very poor story overall, the dragged-out unnecessary dialogue made this film unbearable and extremely boring. The way too long 1h 39min film length felt like 4 hours and I found myself saying "get on with it already, who cares!" when the two leads would just ramble on about nothing relevant. This movie may have been interesting if it was a 30 min short film (which oddly enough is the only minimal writing experience Adam Gaines has).

The acting was decent and Katia Winter was very easy on the eyes to look at, but her chemistry with Simon Quarterman was very unconvincing. Maybe it was the boring dialogue they had that made their chemistry absent.
