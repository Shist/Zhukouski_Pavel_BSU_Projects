           This is handy when we want to optimize things, e.g.

               >>> from sympy import Mul, S
               >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
               >>> e = Mul(3, x, y)

               >>> e._new_rawargs(*e.args[1:])  # the same as above, but faster
               x*y

           Note: use this with caution. There is no checking of arguments at
           all. This is best used when you are rebuilding an Add or Mul after
           simply removing one or more args. If, for example, modifications,
           result in extra 1s being inserted (as when collecting an
           expression's numerators and denominators) they will not show up in
           the result but a Mul will be returned nonetheless:

               >>> m = (x*y)._new_rawargs(S.One, x); m
               x
               >>> m == x

               >>> m.is_Mul
               True

           Another issue to be aware of is that the commutativity of the result
           is based on the commutativity of self. If you are rebuilding the
           terms that came from a commutative object then there will be no
           problem, but if self was non-commutative then what you are
           rebuilding may now be commutative.

           Although this routine tries to do as little as possible with the
           input, getting the commutativity right is important, so this level
           of safety is enforced: commutativity will always be recomputed if
           self is non-commutative and kwarg `reeval=False` has not been
           passed.

                      returned with the results

        This function is the main workhorse for Add/Mul.

        For instance:

        In the example above, "a+sin(b)*c" is the pattern, and "x+sin(y)*z" is
        the expression.

        The repl_dict contains parts that were already matched. For example
        here:

        >>> (x+sin(b)*c)._matches_commutative(x+sin(y)*z, repl_dict={a: x})
        {a_: x, b_: y, c_: z}

        the only function of the repl_dict is to return it in the

        >>> (x+sin(b)*c)._matches_commutative(x+sin(y)*z)
        {b_: y, c_: z}

        the "a: x" is not returned in the result, but otherwise it is
