    # Every singleton name should be accessible from the 'from sympy import *'
    # namespace in addition to the S object. However, it does not need to be
    # by the same name (e.g., oo instead of S.Infinity).

    # As a general rule, things should only be added to the singleton registry
    # if they are used often enough that code can benefit either from the
    # performance benefit of being able to use 'is' (this only matters in very
    # tight loops), or from the memory savings of having exactly one instance
    # (this matters for the numbers singletons, but very little else). The
    # singleton registry is already a bit overpopulated, and things cannot be
    # removed from it without breaking backwards compatibility. So if you got
    # here by adding something new to the singletons, ask yourself if it
    # really needs to be singletonized. Note that SymPy classes compare to one
    # another just fine, so Class() == Class() will give True even if each
    # Class() returns a new instance. Having unique instances is only
    # necessary for the above noted performance gains. It should not be needed
    # for any behavioral purposes.

    # If you determine that something really should be a singleton, it must be
    # accessible to sympify() without using 'S' (hence this test). Also, its
    # str printer should print a form that does not use S. This is because
    # sympify() disables attribute lookups by default for safety purposes.
